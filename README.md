# Traffic-sign
Created an application in python using TensorFlow and keras environment. This project was part of my MSc Dissertation course work. created a deep neural network model that can categorize traffic signals in images into distinct groups. We can read and understand traffic signs, which is a critical duty for all autonomous vehicles.
